This indicator diffenciates any discrete functions via smoothing
by discrete cosine transformation on Metatrader4.
First, it applies the discrete cosine transformation to the curve,
then differenciate analytically. The 1st and 2nd derivatives can be obtained.

This indicator calculates 1st derivative of forex curve, which
smoothed by the discrete cosine transformation then followed by
a rectangular windowed bandpass filter.

* This indicator is tested on Metatrader4 (Alpari).
* The FFTW library must be installed http://www.fftw.org/ at /usr/local/lib
!NOTE! We use static library instead of dynamic one. We compiled as follows:
$ ./configure --with-our-malloc16 --with-windows-f77-mangling \
--disable-shared --enable-static --enable-threads --with-combined-threads \
--enable-sse2
$ make
$ make install

* Mingw http://www.mingw.org/ must be installed to build this indicator.
* Makefile must be modified: MT4DIR should be adjusted for your environment 
MT4DIR=/c/Program\ Files/Alpari\ Japan\ DEMO\ 1

* Then, just type
$ make clean; make; make install
...

Enjoy!
