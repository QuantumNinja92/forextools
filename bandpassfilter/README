This indicator is a band pass filter for forign exchange market on Metatrader4.
First do the DCT and apply rectangular windowed bandpass filter,
then do back transform. 

* This indicator is tested on Metatrader4 (Alpari).
* The FFTW library must be installed http://www.fftw.org/ at /usr/local/lib
!NOTE! We use static library instead of dynamic one. We compiled as follows:
$ ./configure --with-our-malloc16 --with-windows-f77-mangling \
--disable-shared --enable-static --enable-threads --with-combined-threads \
--enable-sse2
$ make
$ make install

* Mingw http://www.mingw.org/ must be installed to build this indicator.
* Makefile must be modified: MT4DIR should be adjusted for your environment 
MT4DIR=/c/Program\ Files/Alpari\ Japan\ DEMO\ 1

* Then, just type
$ make clean; make; make install



Enjoy!
